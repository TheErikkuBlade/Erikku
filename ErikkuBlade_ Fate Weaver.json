You can predict very vague messages through the divination deck, these messages can be forewarnings of upcoming events. These messages can be as vague as the DM desires. After the question is asked, roll the Divination Deck tool using Charisma. A roll of 9 or lower automatically fails, and the card you draw is blank. A roll of 10 or higher the roll is successful and you receive a vague answer to the question. The message appears on the blank card in a language of your choosing that you can read. The message can only be 50 words or less. The message remains visible on the card for up to 10 minutes, or until you dispel it.

Fate weavers are more akin to sorcerers in that their magic stems directly from the weave itself, but on an even greater scale. Fate weavers are often the children of the weave and their magic is as raw as it comes. Mystra, the goddess of magic, alongside The Raven Queen, the goddess of death and fate, are like 'god mothers' to these children of the weave. ",

Not impossible, but difficult - especially with evocation magic outside of healing. Some of the most deadly spells are outside the reach of most fate weavers, but they do gain access to the most powerful spell any mortal can cast if they make it to that point.",
