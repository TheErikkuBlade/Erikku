Through the use of the deck of sixty and the stars they are capable of tapping into the future, though the farther they look, the less clear things become. Some Astrologians travel the land to share this gift of foresight with everyone, while others seek out opportunities to spread their young order of magic around the realm. Others track down allies and adventure, as the stars had mandated that the Astrologian set out on a quest for a task which they cannot see the end of.

										"Whether driven by the wish to make a difference in a dangerous world, the need to take vengeance for a great wrong they have suffered, being inspired by witnessing the strange and powerful techniques of another blood hunter in person, or just seeking a place to belong in an uncaring world, the reasons one may take up the Hunter's Bane and choose this life are many and varied. In joining an order of blood hunters, one is also joining a tight family bound by service to each other and the common cause. For many, this is the only family they have known or have left, so the kinship felt between members of an order is a bond neigh unbreakable.",
										"Beyond the boundaries of the order, however, the life of a blood hunter is often not an easy one. The rituals of the Hunter's Bane regularly leave one visibly changed and prone to unsettle common folk, and the witnessing of hemocraft can invoke a superstitious fear from even the most learned scholar. While some societies have come to accept the good deeds of the orders, many blood hunters publicly hide their nature unless absolutely necessary, feeling more comfortable in the wilds and wastes of the world where the Orders commonly train. Even so, the best work a blood hunter can do usually involves the poor and defenseless on the outskirts of society, those prone to the corrupting touch of fiends and dark intension. Braving the threat of vilification, these dark protectors wade through civilization, earning coin as mercenaries or bounty hunters, ever watching for the signs of something more nefarious beneath the surface.",
										"In choosing this path, a blood hunter has irrevocably given a part of themselves to their cause, physically, emotionally, and sometimes morally. The orders of blood hunters practice their own unique ideals and methods, often employing techniques with dark origins that test the strength and will of these guardians. Many wrestle with the fear of losing this struggle, so a life of discipline and vigilance drives their travels as they wander the country side in search of like-minded adventurers and whispers of dark deeds afoot."

										"As you create a blood hunter, the most important aspects of your character are why you were driven to this lifestyle, and why do you seek to give up everything to wallow in the dark with the evils you hunt? Did you lose a loved one to a fiendish beast and now wish to prevent others from suffering the same fate? Do you seek a sense of purpose and security, and found this among the order that has taken you in? Have you always carried a seed of darkness within you, and seek kin to watch over you and prevent you succumbing to it? Were you once a holy warrior who strayed from his faith and was cast out, but still seek to give yourself to the cause of protecting the innocent? Or are you a criminal with a dark past seeking to make amends, taking this life as a path of penance?",

Do you respect and fear the ancient power that surges through your veins, using them only when necessary? Do you relish in the strength it offers you, embracing your gifts and using them freely? Are you worried the superstitions are right, and this power will eventually turn you into one of the monsters you hunt? Or has your study instilled you with the confident control of mind over matter, certain you can bend these gifts to bring a brighter dawn?",
										"Consider too that while a blood hunter belongs to an order, many strike out on their own to do their best work. What made you leave the comfort of your order? Do you intend to return, or have you decided you have more to learn in the world beyond? What do you seek in other adventurers that can help you meet your goals?",
										"While most blood hunters follow a path of good or neutrality in their pursuits, some have fallen to the dark, seductive side of hemo craft and use their abilities for selfish and evil purposes. These deviants are always thrown from the order, and often hunted along with the creatures they once trained to fell."

Adam spent many of his early years in life honing his skills, so that one day he could craft a weapon that would impress even his own father. Joseph was a harsh mentor for Adam, always telling his son what was wrong with his work rather than what he liked about it. Despite this harsh criticism, Adam kept forging hoping that one day he would get a different result. One day, Joseph stopped coming into Adam’s workshop. Adam was surprised, he usually came in to watch him work every day, no matter how young, old, sick, or busy he was. He never traveled, not without his son; not since his wife, Adam’s mother, was killed on an expedition when he was six. ",

He cursed the hammer for taking his father, and left it to forge his own desires. He worked day and night, crafting the most powerful weapon in the world. A mighty sword that could vanquish any foe, one that would grant the user unbelievable strength. With the aid of Moradin, through constant prayer, he had finally done it. Three years after his father’s death he had finally made the weapon. Why Moradin helped is unknown. Could it have been his respect to his father, and repayment for the grief his death brought? Could it have been the reward for ambition? Who knows, not even Adam does. He presented the weapon to an adventurer who had heard about the weapon and offered a large amount of coin, claiming 10,000 platinum. Sought with greed, and still in his younger naive years, he presented the weapon to the adventurer, only to have it stolen out of his hands and struck by his own blade. Leaving him wounded to near death, even with a non-lethal strike. Why his life was spared was also unknown, but the adventurer left him, smiling evilly as he massacred his hometown, and proceeded to go from town-to-town reeking havoc everywhere he went."

The blue-clad priests of Mystran temples count wizards and sorcerers among their numbers, as well as the occasional bard. The goal of Mystra's faithful is simple: that magic be preserved and promulgated throughout the Realms. It isn't unusual for her followers to keep an eye out for those who demonstrate high potential for using magic and help arrange for such persons to find tutelage with a suitable mentor.",

Though now with her resurrection and faith having been lost in the weave and magic as a whole, her power is far less than it had been. Mystra tends to the Weave constantly, making possible all the miracles and mysteries wrought by magic and users of magic. She is believed to be the embodiment of the Weave and of magic itself, though this is now known to be false in the wake of the Spellplague. When the weave collapsed with her death, magic still existed, but in a different form as before. Adaptation was forced on society, and magic users still found ways to use their power, though it had taken far more work and could cause chaos since the wild forms of magic were more prevalent.",
							"With her resurrection and the re-establishment of the weave, magic is now easier to control and use, but time and distrust makes it less of worth-while pursuit than it had been before, and many users still prefer the more wild uses that were established during the time of the spellplague."

							"The Church of Avandra represents one of the most open, tolerant, and accepting of all the different faiths. One of the core tenets of the faith demands open-mindedness and the willingness to learn new things.",
							"Overall, Avandra’s faith has little in the way of formal ritual, liturgy, or hierarchy. Followers of Avandra are amongst the most individualistic of any faith, and the same holds true for her clergy.",
							"In general, people call upon Avandra either for aid or to give thanks as they live moment to moment. Worship of Avandra seldom centers on a temple, incense, or other trappings of religion. As a result, her overall church remains relatively small, disorganized, and thus lacks the power or influence of larger churches. Instead of congregations, worship of Avandra involves individuals or small groups, usually as they travel or explore.",
							"Spheres of Influence: Change, luck, travelers, trade, adventurers, wanderers, seekers, the lost",
							"Avatar: According to legend, the Goddess of Change vastly prefers exploring and traveling the Middle World or the Feywild to living in her domain in the Astral Sea. As long as she does not directly intervene in mortal affairs (at least not in a major way), she avoids breaking the Covenant or angering other gods.",
							"Avandra’s avatar is frequently female, often half-elf or elven in appearance. She typically wears rugged traveling clothes and carries a well-worn walking staff. It is also believed she sometimes travels as a large owl when she wishes to fly.",
							"Signs & Portents: The appearance of landmark, milestone, or clue leading to civilization to the lost is frequently hailed as a sign from Avandra. Likewise, the unexpected appearance of a source of water, food, or shelter in the midst of the wilderness signals Avandra’s blessings. Avandra reveals her displeasure in dark storm clouds and angry winds.",
							"Tenets of the Faith: Luck favors the bold. Take your fate into your own hands, and Avandra smiles upon you. Avandra calls upon her priests and worshippers to practice self-reliance as much as possible, and to teach this same attribute to others. If you wait for someone else to do what needs to be done or meet your needs, you are likely to wait for a long time. At times, opportunity demands risk and boldness, and followers of Avandra must be prepared to act.",
							"Strike back against those who would rob you of your freedom and urge others to fight for their own liberty. Avandra’s faith promotes freedom as one of the most important parts of life. Without freedom, all things lose importance and value. Clerics of Avandra must, when necessary, fight to protect their freedoms.",
							"Travel whenever and wherever possible. In Avandra’s faith, travel represents one of the best ways to learn and gain experience. As a cleric travels, he gains an appreciation for his own customs, as well as those of other cultures. Travel broadens the mind, challenges the body, and promotes learning.",
							"Aid the lost or forlorn. A cleric of Avandra is duty-bound to assist those in need when possible. Most often, this applies to individuals lost, either physically or spiritually. The cleric of Avandra is expected to share his fortune to the benefit of others.",
							"Change is inevitable, but it takes the work of the faithful to ensure that change is for the better. Avandra’s faith holds high regard for the concept of tolerance towards and acceptance of other creatures and their beliefs. Her worshippers are taught to avoid being close-minded, intolerant, or prejudiced of something merely because it is different. There are a number of reasons for the importance of this tenet, not the least of which is the inevitability of change. As the saying goes, change is the only constant. Followers of Avandra must accept this fact and use their faith and goodwill to create change for the better. Her worshippers must remain open to change, and always look for opportunities in change.",
							"Avoid violent conflict when possible. Although it would be a mistake to label Avandra as a pacifistic deity, her faith promotes peaceful interactions whenever and wherever possible. The goddess certainly allows for self-defense and protecting the innocent or helpless, but her faith teaches the value of compromise and negotiation when possible. That being said, her clerics are expected to fight for freedom, and to encourage others to do likewise. At times, negotiation and compromise are out of the question, and action is called for.",
							"Waste nothing. Also central to Avandra’s teachings is the concept of not wasting anything. If you hunt and kill, do not kill more than you can eat. If you must cut down trees for firewood, cut down only what is absolutely necessary. Waste is considered a sin in Avandra’s eyes.",
							"Holy Symbol: Three-fold wave of forest green",
							"Place of Worship: Roadside shrines, impromptu outdoor chapels. There are relatively few permanent temples dedicated to Avandra; her clergy do not see any great need for large buildings or impressive structures. To the followers of the Goddess of Change, the best place to worship is when the need arises, regardless of where you are at the moment. Worship services dedicated to Avandra are usually brief, simple, and yet elegant.",
							"Canon: The Wayfarer’s Journal. Avandra’s “bible” represents one of the most unorthodox, yet easy-to-read, holy texts of almost any religion. The Wayfarer’s Journal reads much like a travelogue, with bits and pieces of trivia mingled with common sense and wisdom for the wanderer. The book is poorly organized, and exists in countless different variations, and no one version is considered better than the others.",
							"Cleric’s Alignment: Although good or lawful good are preferred alignments, unaligned is also permissible.",
							"Duties of the Priesthood: A cleric of Avandra is bound by his beliefs to assist those who have become lost whenever possible, including providing shelter, food, and water. Clerics of Avandra are often called upon to scout trails, explore wilderness regions, and rescue the lost or helpless. Her priests are also called on to encourage tolerance and the pursuit of new experiences, both of which require an open-minded approach to life.",
							"With freedom an important element of Avandra’s faith, her clerics are called upon to do what they can to promote liberty for others. Often, direct confrontation or violence is the wrong answer, but her clerics are encouraged to find other ways to fight for freedom – both their and that of others. This is not to imply that her priests are required to incite revolts and set free criminals; at times, direction action is impractical or unwarranted. Clerics of Avandra must do what they can for individuals, but they do not seek to become rabble-rousers or leaders of some rebellion.",
							"In the case of criminals, they have already made choices to abandon their liberties and freedoms, and as such do not deserve Avandra’s aid. Her concerns are reserved for those without choice or opportunity.",
							"Limitations & Sacrifices: Do not waste resources, do not inflict wanton or meaningless destruction, do not kill unless necessary.",
							"Once per month, clerics of Avandra undergo two days of ritual fasting so that they may better appreciate the plight of the lost and the hungry.",
							"Although clerics of Avandra are not terribly interested or concerned with material possessions, they are encouraged to donate what they can to aid others in need. Too many possessions – even in coin or gems – is a burden to be avoided. Material possessions can easily become distractions or, in the worst case, another form of imprisonment. When an individual focuses too much on possessions, he becomes enslaved to greed and other base emotions."

His brother Sergei came to live with him in Castle Ravenloft, becoming Strahd's adviser and constant companion.",

At the wedding of Sergei and Tatyana, he confronted his brother and killed him. Tatyana fled and flung herself from Ravenloft's walls. Strahd's guards, seeing him for a monster, shot him with arrows. But he did not die. He became a vampire-the first vampire, according to many sages.",

In the eyes of sylvan beings, none compare in their mastery of the arcane and of trickery. They keep grudges for what seems like eternity, and will not let up on the chase for something even if it means watching from a distance their prey weaken and diminish. Always with a other-worldly grace to them, they look similar to elves but have wings that take the form of either ones belonging to insects like dragonflys or birds.

If the creature takes damage by you or your companions, this effect ends. If they pass the saving throw, they do not know you were attempting to charm them. While charmed in this way, they see you as a close friend and are more willing to share sensitive information with you."

									"The Kagon are a nocturnal desert tribe who worship Nhaama, goddess of the moon and mortal enemy of Azim, god of the sun. Instructed by their goddess that to step into the sun is to succumb to the evil of Azim, they spend the daylight hours in their tents, only emerging to hunt and migrate at night. The result is an uncharacteristically pale skin for a group of people living in an almost eternally fair-weather locale."

								],

									"Dataq",

								],
								[
									"Moks",
									"A tribe invisible for the fact that its members are spread out across many different tribes (unbeknownst to those tribes). Communication between its members is done on the rare occasion when two tribes meet, through an ancient set of hand signals only recognizable by those who know what they are looking for."
								],
								[
									"Geneq",
									"In addition to the standard language used by most of the Xaela in cross-tribe communication, the Geneq employ a complex system of whistles and clicks which resemble the cloud- and wavekin of the steppe."
								],
								[
									"Horo",
									"To those who live the meager lifestyles of the steppedwellers, being overweight is a symbol of affluence and power. To appear heavier than one in their station, the members of Horo will drink copious amounts of water to bloat their bellies."
								],
								[
									"Himaa",
									"For reasons unknown, one out of every three pregnancies amongst the Himaa result in twins. As a result, over half the tribe's members have a doppelganger. This can prove an advantage during attacks, as it confuses the enemy into believing the dead have risen."
								],
								[
									"Malaguld",
									"One of the only tribes that accepts people of the Raen--those that have been exiled, or those who have fled persecution--into their circle."
								],
								[
									"Urumet",
									"This desert tribe has the queer custom of travelling with their elders carried upon their shoulders. It is believed that in the flat desert, this gives the tribe the advantage of being able to see farther."
