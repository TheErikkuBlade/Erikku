				"You attempt to influence a creature to become friendly toward you and your companions by using the ancient magics of the Feywild. You target one creature within range of the spell, if they are unwilling that target makes a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is {@condition charmed} by you. While {@condition charmed} by you, they become very friendly toward you and follow your commands to the best of their ability. A creature {@condition charmed} in this way will not do anything that may seem harmful to them, outside of fighting another creature. In addition, at the start of each of their turns they regain {@dice 1d6} hit points as long as they have at least 1 hit point.",
