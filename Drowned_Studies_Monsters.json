Adam spent many of his early years in life honing his skills, so that one day he could craft a weapon that would impress even his own father. Joseph was a harsh mentor for Adam, always telling his son what was wrong with his work rather than what he liked about it. Despite this harsh criticism, Adam kept forging hoping that one day he would get a different result. One day, Joseph stopped coming into Adam’s workshop. Adam was surprised, he usually came in to watch him work every day, no matter how young, old, sick, or busy he was. He never traveled, not without his son; not since his wife, Adam’s mother, was killed on an expedition when he was six. ",

He worked day and night, crafting the most powerful weapon in the world. A mighty sword that could vanquish any foe, one that would grant the user unbelievable strength. With the aid of Moradin, through constant prayer, he had finally done it. Three years after his father’s death he had finally made the weapon. Why Moradin helped is unknown. Could it have been his respect to his father, and repayment for the grief his death brought? Could it have been the reward for ambition? Who knows, not even Adam does. He presented the weapon to an adventurer who had heard about the weapon and offered a large amount of coin, claiming 10,000 platinum. Sought with greed, and still in his younger naive years, he presented the weapon to the adventurer, only to have it stolen out of his hands and struck by his own blade. Leaving him wounded to near death, even with a non-lethal strike. Why his life was spared was also unknown, but the adventurer left him, smiling evilly as he massacred his hometown, and proceeded to go from town-to-town reeking havoc everywhere he went."
